Project Title: Sales Analysis Dashboard
Project Description: The objective of this project was to create a dashboard to analyze sales data for a  e-commerce company. The dashboard was designed to provide insights into the company's sales performance, product trends, and customer behavior.
Tools Used: Amazon QuickSight, Amazon Redshift, Amazon S3
Steps Taken:
1. Data Collection: We collected the sales data from the company's transactional database, which was hosted on Amazon Redshift.
2. Data Preparation: We used Amazon Glue to clean and transform the data, and then stored it in Amazon S3.
3. Data Visualization: We created a new analysis in Amazon QuickSight and connected it to our data source in S3. We then created several visualizations, including a line chart to track sales revenue over time, a bar chart to analyze product sales by category.
4. Sharing and Collaboration: We shared our dashboard with the company's management team, who were able to access it through a secure link. We also enabled collaboration features, which allowed users to add comments and share insights with each other.
